## Calculator

‚öôÔ∏è Calculator made with basic HTML5, CSS3 and raw JavaScript.

üìà I made this calculator to step up my knoledge about JavaScript, and to know if my knowledge about HTML and CSS was enough to build the calculator on my own.

‚úÖ You can prove that this calculator works downloading the repository and executing the HTML file with your preferred browser.

‚≠êÔ∏è As an extra feature, you can drag and drop the entire calculator, moving it where you want inside the browser window.
